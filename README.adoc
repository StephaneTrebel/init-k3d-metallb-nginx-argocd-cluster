= A propos

This repo is based on a link:./Makefile[Makefile] and a couple scripts to handle the easy boostrapping of:

* A https://k3d.io[k3d] cluster installed locally with one server and three agents

NOTE: Having three agents helps in simulating a «true» cluster, with its multiple nodes.

* With https://metallb.org/[metallb] as its external Load Balancer

NOTE: This is also for better simulation purposes, and because I wanted to practice a bit with metallb configuration

* With https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/[nginx ingress controller] as its, well, Ingress Controller 😁

NOTE: This is also for better «real world» simulation purposes, and also because a lot of ingresses are Nginx and not Traefik based 🥲

== Requirements

I don't like to locally install CLIs through Makefiles so here is a list of all the tools used.
Feel free to fork and adapt to your convenience !

* GNU make v4.3
* k3d v5.4.6 (k3s v1.24.4)
* kubectl v1.26.1
* argocd v2.3.13
* https://www.passwordstore.org/[pass] v1.7.4

== How to use

Well, it's all in the link:./Makefile[Makefile] !

Just follow the rules in their order and you should be fine 😉
